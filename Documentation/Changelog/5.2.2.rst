Fixes

* Fix import of events with file inconsistency if possible.

  Those would previously lead to a broken import, as TYPO3 would throw an unhandled
  exception.

  We now adjust the file extension to match mime type, for images only.
  The exception, if still exists, is now catched, and converted to a warning log entry instead.
