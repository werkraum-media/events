* Make time zone for slugs configurable.

  Slugs of dates are generated during import.
  This might lead to confusion if the time zone differs from frontend.
  Therefore the time zone is now configurable to allow adjustments for the actual
  website.

  A new interface `TimeZoneProviderInterface` is provided which can be re configured to a
  different implementation.

  The default implementation will use TYPO3s `SYS.phpTimeZone` setting, with fall
  back to `date_default_timezone_get()` call.
  That way it should be useful for most systems out of the box.

* Handle destination.one files without file name.

  It is possible to have files such as `https://dam.destination.one/2675868/3dc0a9dccd0dad46c73e669ece428c634ff8324ea3d01a4858a1c43169deed41/.jpg`.
  Those were not handled correctly yet.
  We now also handle those cases.
  We will generate a hash from the URL as file name in order to still use those files.
