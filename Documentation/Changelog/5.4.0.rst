5.4.0
=====

Breaking
--------

Nothing

Features
--------

* Add support for PHP 8.5.

* Handle errors during import of single event.
  Those will be logged, and no longer break the whole import.
  The import will continue with next event.

* Support paging of destination.one API. That way we remove the rest_limit
  configuration option and always import all available events.

* Associate imported events with the corresponding import configuration.
  This is exposed as read only field in TYPO3 backend.
  This adds some debugging info for editors and admins, and paves the way for future
  features.

* Cleanup no longer existing events during import.
  Those are deleted via TYPO3 API (soft deleted).
  Files are therefore kept until those records are finally removed and files are
  clean up by separate cleanup job.

Fixes
-----

Nothing

Tasks
-----

* Keep working dev state by updating `codappix/typo3-php-datasets` to new major version.
  We still need 1.4 for older TYPO3/PHP versions.

* Get rid of `dg/bypass-finals` for development, as this leads to issues and more maintenance, see: https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/5736#issuecomment-2097701770
  We now use better architecture, e.g. interfaces for stubbing instead.

Deprecation
