Fixes

* Fix broken data processing within model in newer TYPO3 version.

  TYPO3 changed how models are instantiated and prepared.
  We now adopt the code to still initialize the data processing.
  Furthermore, the feature is now covered with a test.

* Fix broken data processing caching within model.

  Each model might have different pages.
  The previous caching implementation would share the result between multiple
  instances.
  This is now solved via an internal property instead of static variable.
