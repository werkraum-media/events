Fixes
-----

* Handle destination.one files without file name.

  It is possible to have files such as `https://dam.destination.one/2675868/3dc0a9dccd0dad46c73e669ece428c634ff8324ea3d01a4858a1c43169deed41/.jpg`.
  Those were not handled correctly yet.
  We now also handle those cases.
  We will generate a hash from the URL as file name in order to still use those files.

Tasks
-----

* Add image handling support in nix shell.
