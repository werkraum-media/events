Breaking
--------

Namespace changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new namespace was defined for plugins which is "events_search".
The search parameters are now collected below namespace "search" instead of
"events_search" leading to ``events_search[search][parametername]=value`` instead of
``tx_events_signature[events_search][parametername]=value``.

The form now is submitted as post and redirects to a proper URL with GET.

The code was bloated and made it hard to fix bugs.

Necessary steps:

- Check usage of old namespace within templates and other sources.

- Check usage of old nesting of parameters.

API Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^

The methods of ``DateDemand`` have changed, ``getStart()`` and ``getEnd()`` return a
string value necessary or Fluid forms.
Those are not considered public API. Use ``getStartObject()`` and ``getEndObject()``
instead.

Fixes
-----

* Keep filter during pagination

  Search requests are POST by default.
  We apply PRG (=Post Redirect Get) on them to create proper GET requests.
  Those can be used to generate the URLs for pagination.

  We follow Extbase, and do not explicitly ask for arguments from foreign namespaces.
  Instead we configure a pluginNamespace that's shared between plugins.
  This is all necessary as we still ship pre defined plugins.
  This should belong into integration of each project.
