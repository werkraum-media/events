3.9.0
=====

Breaking
--------

Nothing

Features
--------

* Add grouping of locations.
  It is now possible to group locations.
  Each location can have arbitrary children.

  That can be used for editorial structuring.
  Filtering for a location will always find all dates where the location or one of the child locations is assigned.

  One use case can be to group imported locations and provide a grouped location for filtering in frontend.

Backport of 4.0.0 features:

* Add meta tags.
  A new class is added which will add meta tags for dates and events.
  The class has an interface which allows it to be replaced via DI to alter behaviour.

* Import keywords for events from destination.one.
  That way keywords are available for usage in meta tags.

* Add page title provider. That way it is possible to alter the TYPO3 page title when showing a date or event.
