2.1.0
=====

Breaking
--------

Nothing

Features
--------

* ``DateDemandFactory`` supports TypoScript ``stdWrap`` on all settings on first level.

* New option ``queryCallback`` for ``DateDemand`` was added.
  This option allows to define a callback in TYPO3 way (e.g. function, closure or method ``->``).
  This receives the ``DateRepository`` as well as the current ``QueryInterface`` to alter query after it was created based on the ``DateDemand``.

* Add Changelog to document changes for each version.

Fixes
-----

* ``DateRepository`` now properly fetches ``Date`` if no ``start`` and no ``end`` was given.
  It fetched only upcoming ``Date`` beforehand.
  It will now fetch all ``Date`` where either the start OR end is in future.
  That way also currently active ``Date`` are returned.
  Converting default from "future" to "running and future".

Tasks
-----

* Moved creation of ``DateDemand`` out of ``DateController`` into a new ``DateDemandFactory``.
  That allows re use of creation from settings.
  This also streamlines creation with ``EventDemand`` and ``EventDemandFactory``.

* Removed outdated stuff from Documentation.

Deprecation
-----------

Nothing
