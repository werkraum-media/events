Fixes

* Respect timezone for recurring events.
  Some events occur over multiple time zones (same time zone but summer and winter time).
  We ensure PHP creates those objects as expected so we do not use the current offset,
  but the one of that date.

* Tests won't work after a specific date, we ensure they will work all the time.
