Features
--------

* Handles date intervals without given ``repeatUntil`` property.
  A default of ``+60 days`` is hard coded.
  The actual date span can be configured via TypoScript.

Fixes
-----

* Do not break import on missing image

  Guzzle might throw exceptions instead of returning the response.
  We extend our import to also watch out for exceptions and handle them the same way
  as a response other than 200.
