3.1.0
=====

Breaking
--------

Nothing

Features
--------

* Handles date intervals without given ``repeatUntil`` property.
  A default of ``+60 days`` is hard coded.
  The actual date span can be configured via TypoScript.

* Pages can now define they store event records. 
  A new entry was added to select and the icon within page tree will be replaced.

* Provided update wizard to migrate old location data to new one.
  It is important to execute the database compare once, so old columns are prefixed but not removed.
  Execute wizard and you are done.
  Locations will be extracted from old events and placed on same pid.
  You might wanna move all locations to a dedicated new pid in the end, e.g. with an sql query (Replace 2 by your page uid):

  .. code-block:: sql

     UPDATE tx_events_domain_model_location SET pid = 2

Fixes
-----

* Do not break import on missing image

  Guzzle might throw exceptions instead of returning the response.
  We extend our import to also watch out for exceptions and handle them the same way
  as a response other than 200.

  Relates: #10253

* Support import of png images from Destination One.

* Do not break TYPO3 v11.5 extension compatibility check.
  The ``addStaticFile()`` method has to be called from ``Configuration/TCA/Overrides/`` instead of ``ext_tables.php`` as this might break frontend.

Tasks
-----

* Update Icons.
