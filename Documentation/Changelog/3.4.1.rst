* Do not break Upgrade Wizards in install tool.

  TYPO3 does not provide a BE_USER within install tool.
  That will break the Upgrade Wizards as they use DataHandler that relies on an existing backend user.
  This was not an issue on command line where _cli_ user will be created and used by TYPO3.
  The extension now adds an _events_ user as admin as well when necessary.
