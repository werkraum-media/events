2.6.0
=====

Breaking
--------

* The location columns within events will no longer be filled.
  The new location will be used instead.
  The model will fall back for existing old records.
  Therefore this should not end in an effect on existing systems.
  The model no longer has setters for location beside the location itself.

Features
--------

* Support PHP 8.1.

* Search location name and organizer name when a search word for dates was given.

* Introduce new record ``Location``.
  This is the actual event location which is stored as separate record instead of
  inline properties within the event.
  This allows to filter by location.

* Provide new stable Pagination within Controller and used Templates.
  This makes the Extension compatible with v10, v11 and v12 regarding pagination.
  The template now also follows https://www.a11ymatters.com/pattern/pagination/ for
  accessibility.
  Feel free to copy the template to projects.

Deprecation
-----------

* Usage of location related properties from within the Event.
  Use the new sub property Location instead.

* Location related database columns within ``tx_events_domain_model_event``.
  Use ``tx_events_domain_model_location`` instead.
