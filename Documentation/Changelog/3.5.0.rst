Breaking
--------

Nothing

Features
--------

* Add PSR-14 Events to Destination Data One import.
  They allow individual installation to alter the import.

  See :ref:`psr14` for an overview of PSR-14 Events.

  Added Events:

  * Allow to modify an event object before importing.

Fixes
-----

* Improve handling of dates with no end.
  This was always technically possible. Still support from extension was missing.
  This now got improved, the date object will not throw exceptions due to ``format()`` calls on none.
  Furthermore the PHPDoc now reflects that there might be null instead of ``\DateTime``.
  Also the setter was adjusted to allow ``null`` values.
