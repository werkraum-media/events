4.0.0
=====

Breaking
--------

* Drop support of TYPO3 and PHP versions.
  We drop support for any TYPO3 version below 12.
  We drop support for PHP versions not supported by TYPO3 v12.
  That eases the maintenance of the extension.

* Change of vendor/namespace.
  The vendor was renamed from `wrm` to `werkraummedia`.
  And the namespace vendor was renamed from `Wrm` to `WerkraumMedia`.

  That way all references to PHP classes as well as the package name itself need to
  be adjusted.

* No longer allow records on standard pages.
  Please use TCA Overrides in case you need this none default TYPO3 behaviour.

Features
--------

* Support TYPO3 v12.

* Support PHP 8.1, 8.2, 8.3.
