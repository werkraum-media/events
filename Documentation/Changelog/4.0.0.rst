4.0.0
=====

Breaking
--------

* Drop support of TYPO3 and PHP versions.
  We drop support for any TYPO3 version below 12.
  We drop support for PHP versions not supported by TYPO3 v12.
  That eases the maintenance of the extension.

* Change of vendor/namespace.
  The vendor was renamed from `wrm` to `werkraummedia`.
  And the namespace vendor was renamed from `Wrm` to `WerkraumMedia`.

  That way all references to PHP classes as well as the package name itself need to
  be adjusted.

* No longer allow records on standard pages.
  Please use TCA Overrides in case you need this none default TYPO3 behaviour.

Features
--------

* Support TYPO3 v12.

* Support PHP 8.1, 8.2, 8.3.

* Add meta tags.
  A new class is added which will add meta tags for dates and events.
  The class has an interface which allows it to be replaced via DI to alter behaviour.

* Import keywords for events from destination.one.
  That way keywords are available for usage in meta tags.

* Add page title provider.
  That way it is possible to alter the TYPO3 page title when showing a date or event.

* Add Social Media Tags by default.
  https://ogp.me/ is used by some platforms, especially social media, to generate previews of shared links.
  The extension now delivers default open-graph tags for better user experience.
  Twitter uses its own way which is also supported.
