Features
--------

* Import configuration can now be configured as database records within TYPO3 folders.
  This allows for better support (e.g. permission of backend users and validation and wizards like page selection).
  Two new import commands are added.
  One allows to process all available import configurations.
  The other allows to process a single import configuration which needs to be configured.

* Add new option ``query`` to ``DestinationDataImportCommand``.
  It is appended as ``q`` parameter to the initial search URL to fetch data for import.
  The value is documented at https://developer.et4.de/reference/current/#eT4META-search-param-q.html.
  Further documentation can be found at https://developer.et4.de/reference/current/#eT4META-search-querylanguage-Introduction.html.
