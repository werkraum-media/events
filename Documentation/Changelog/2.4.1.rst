Fixes
-----

* Crop title of imported files.
  `sys_file_metadata` table column `title` is limited in length.
  We now crop long file titles to maximum of 100 characters to prevent issues during storing title.

* Fix endless import loop.
  Import of weekly dates got broken while refactoring.
  We keep existing logic of creation but ensure that we won't end up in an endless loop.
