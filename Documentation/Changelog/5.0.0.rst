5.0.0
=====

Breaking
--------

* Only when being on 13.x or higher:

  Content elements are no longer registered as `list` but with their own CType.
  An upgrade wizard is provided that can be executed to migrate existing database
  entries.

  But custom TypoScript and modifications need to be adopted.
  We recommend not to use the provided plugins but build your own tailored content
  elements instead.

Features
--------

* Add Support for TYPO3 v13.4 LTS.

* Support large rest search queries.
  The field no longer has a limitation.
  The field is now stored as text instead of varchar.

Fixes
-----

Nothing

Tasks
-----

Nothing

Deprecation
-----------

* The existing content elements are deprecated.
  We recommend to build your own dedicated content elements.
