5.0.0
=====

Breaking
--------

* Removed all content elements.

  Content elements are no longer provided.
  We recommend to build your own tailored content elements instead.

* Remaining TypoScript constants for import were moved.

  Those are now part of the import configuration record.
  The previous default values will be inserted.
  Make sure to update the existing records to include the necessary values.

  Some value are now hard coded as we do not support other values anyway.

  This also affects the `repeatUntil` TypoScript setting which is now moved to the import configuration.

* Removed old update wizards.

  Update to 4.x beforehand if you still need to execute them.

Features
--------

* Add Support for TYPO3 v13.4 LTS.

* Support large rest search queries.

  The field no longer has a limitation.
  The field is now stored as `text` instead of `varchar`.

* Deliver 404 on date show action without a given date.

  This previously triggered an TYPO3 Exception.
  We now handle the situation and trigger a TYPO3 404.

Fixes
-----

* Ensure pagination settings are provided in expected type (int).
  TypoScript settings will always be strings, so we fix this with a proper type cast.

* Fix broken pagination routing in combination with active search for TYPO3 12.4 and onwards.
  See: :ref:`searchPagination`.
