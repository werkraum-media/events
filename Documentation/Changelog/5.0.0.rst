5.0.0
=====

Breaking
--------

* Only when being on 13.x or higher:

  Content elements are no longer registered as `list` but with their own CType.
  An upgrade wizard is provided that can be executed to migrate existing database
  entries.

  But custom TypoScript and modifications need to be adopted.
  We recommend not to use the provided plugins but build your own tailored content
  elements instead.

Features
--------

* Add Support for TYPO3 v13.4 LTS.
