5.0.0
=====

Breaking
--------

* Only when being on 13.x or higher:

  Content elements are no longer registered as `list` but with their own CType.
  An upgrade wizard is provided that can be executed to migrate existing database
  entries.

  But custom TypoScript and modifications need to be adopted.
  We recommend not to use the provided plugins but build your own tailored content
  elements instead.

* Remaining TypoScript constants for import were moved.

  Those are now part of the import configuration record.
  The previous default values will be inserted.
  Make sure to update the existing records to include the necessary values.

  Some value are now hard coded as we do not support other values anyway.

  This also affects the `repeatUntil` TypoScript setting which is now moved to the import configuration.

Features
--------

* Add Support for TYPO3 v13.4 LTS.

* Support large rest search queries.

  The field no longer has a limitation.
  The field is now stored as text instead of varchar.

Fixes

Nothing

Tasks

Deprecation
-----------
