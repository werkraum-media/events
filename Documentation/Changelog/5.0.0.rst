5.0.0
=====

Breaking
--------

* Removed all content elements.

  Content elements are no longer provided.
  We recommend to build your own tailored content elements instead.

* Remaining TypoScript constants for import were moved.

  Those are now part of the import configuration record.
  The previous default values will be inserted.
  Make sure to update the existing records to include the necessary values.

  Some value are now hard coded as we do not support other values anyway.

  This also affects the `repeatUntil` TypoScript setting which is now moved to the import configuration.

* Removed old update wizards.

  Update to 4.x beforehand if you still need to execute them.

Features
--------

* Add Support for TYPO3 v13.4 LTS.

* Support large rest search queries.

  The field no longer has a limitation.
  The field is now stored as `text` instead of `varchar`.
