Fixes
-----

* Fix broken TCA for highlight property.
  The highlight could not be saved.
  An unexpected value (3) was submitted on selection.
  We now migrated the property to look and act the same as hidden input.

* Fix broken assignment of features and categories.
  The import contained a bug that lead to summing up relations between events and
  categories and features.
  The same relations would be added over and over again with every new import.
  This leads to performance issues when editing or storing events through TYPO3
  backend.
  The import is adjusted to no longer use Extbase but DataHandler for this task.
  This circumvents the issues introduced by Extbase.
  This is the first step to migration of import to be fully using DataHandler +
  doctrine DBAL in the future.
  One drawback is the slowdown of the import.
  But we don't expect people to run it that often.
  Also a working import with proper logging (history, permissions, etc.) seems better
  than a broken but fast import.
