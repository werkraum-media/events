3.3.0
=====

Breaking
--------

Nothing

Features
--------

* Add PHP 8.2 support.

* Added option to filter dates by organizers.
  The new setting works the same way as existing ``locations``.
  Add a comma separated list of UIDs.
  This can be used via FlexForms or TypoScript.
  Can also be used as filter from request, where an array of UIDs is expected.

Fixes
-----

* Fix changing slugs for dates on re import.
  The UID was part of the slug.
  Each import will delete all dates and re create them.
  That would lead to new slugs due to new uid.
  The default now was changed to use the event title (as before) and start (as
  before) with time (new).
  That should hopefully be unique enough.

Tasks
-----

* Solve PHPUnit deprecation: "Passing an argument of type Generator for the $haystack parameter is deprecated. Support for this will be removed in PHPUnit 10."
  Migrate iterator to array within tests.

Deprecation
-----------

Nothing
