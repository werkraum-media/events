TYPO3 V11
=========

Changes that should happen once we drop TYPO3 v11.

Remove ``SlidingWindowPagination`` backport.
--------------------------------------------

We backported https://docs.typo3.org/c/typo3/cms-core/main/en-us/Changelog/12.0/Feature-94625-IntroduceSlidingWindowPagination.html.
That allowed us to use the new Code compatible with v12 onwards.

We should remove the file ``Classes/Backports/V12/Pagination/SlidingWindowPagination.php`` and switch to TYPO3 native class within ``Wrm\Events\Pagination\Factory``.
