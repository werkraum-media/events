TYPO3 Events Extension
======================

A basic events extension

This is shared as is. It is developed and used by the agency for some years already.
The code and test coverage dates back some years.
We continuously try to improve the overall situation.
Don't expect heavy documentation at this state.

The main benefit is an import of destination.one events into TYPO3. More info: https://www.destination.one/
You might find old references to "destination data" within the code as there was a rebranding.
